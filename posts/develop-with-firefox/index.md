What is your favorite environment to develop new [web applications](http://www.firstprinciplesmanagement.com/)?

Currently I think there is no way around good ol' [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/). Not because of the browser, but more because of all those addons. It took me some time to find _my_ configuration. Here it is:

- [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
- [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/)
- [Colorzilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/firefox/)
- [Html Validator](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/249)
- [SwitchProxy Tool](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/125)
- [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/60)

But too bad, I'm too lazy to describe them all. Anyway you have to get comfortable with your own list. What's on it?
