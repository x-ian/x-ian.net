I don't know if my slightly outdated Rails 2.2.2 is the problem. But unlike in the fixtures for normal unit tests, I can't use ERb for my ActionMailers templates.

Add this method to your ActionMailer::TestCase to let ERb pre-process your fixtures: 
``` ruby
def read_fixture(action) 
	a = super 
	template = ERB.new(a.join) 
	template.result(binding) 
end
```
