A new blog for my simple thoughts; regarding my work and (some parts of) my private activities. Let's see if and how it grows.

Oh, and yes. Even though this is the very first post, I will add some entries with older dates. Just for me to not forget them. I know that I will fake the history, but hey, who cares?
