Finally I solved all my struggles with my birthdays calendar at once. I just changed my OS... No more [homegrown VBA macros](http://x-ian.net/2009/05/30/outlook-iphone-birthday-synchronisation/) to get what I want from Outlook.

Although I have to admin that even iCal and Addressbook from MacOS are not capable to manage more than 1 birthday per contact out of the box. But [Birthday Scanner X](http://www.zencat.de/files/category-birthdayscanner-x.html) comes to the rescue. And it's free.

If you're still interested in my Outlook macros and have problems, let me know. I will be mercy...
