... me (Christian Neumann) there is nothing special to say. I enjoy programming and mountains. Or vice versa? Don’t know. But I do know that I’m a programmer having fun creating all sorts of running applications.

Read “I’m a programmer” as “I’m not a dedicated architect” (*). So if you look for an architect, maybe (or most likely) for your big enterprise, look somewhere else. There must be all sorts of clever guys out there. Even some for your “architect-only” [thingy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name)‘s.

Oh and yes: [Technology](http://rubyonrails.org/) is great. But at the end of the day it is more the vehicle to get the system going live. And that is what counts (for me).

Just [send me a mail](mailto:x-ian@x-ian.net) if you want to get in touch.

(*) Disclaimer: Not that architecture is unimportant, but it is just one part of the game and not a somehow superior task or role.
